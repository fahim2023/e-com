      "Ashwagandha KSM66, root, botanical, mushroom and vitamin complex:\n \nA synergistic combination of ashwagandha KSM66, other roots, herbs, mushrooms (reishi and cordyceps) and vitamins formulated to support the nervous system, immune system, energy levels, mental performance and a general sense of calm, focus and vitality.\n\nThe adrenal glands produce hormones that underpin the body's mechanisms for coping with physical and mental stress. Overtraining in athletes, chronic anxiety, worry, nervous tension and other factors associated with excessive cortisol release are linked to adrenal exhaustion and fatigue. Over-reliance on caffeine and other stimulants also taxes the adrenals.\n\nThis food supplement helps to regulate hormonal activity, allowing users to better manage their stress response on a day to day basis. This clever formula helps the body to adapt to what it needs - backed by science. \n\nIt combines important nutrients and nutraceuticals that support hormonal and adrenal health. Pantothenic acid, for example, is involved in the synthesis and release of adrenal hormones.\n\nThis ashwagandha complex works best when combined with adequate rest and sound nutrition, and offers support for those who wish to put their body back in balance, boost immunity and reinvigorate their energy levels to better manage life's daily physical and mental stresses.\n\nVitamin B3 (niacin) contributes to normal psychological function, normal energy-yielding metabolism, normal functioning of the nervous system, the maintenance of normal mucous membranes, the maintenance of normal skin and the reduction of tiredness and fatigue. \n\nVitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) contributes to normal energy-yielding metabolism, normal mental performance, normal synthesis and metabolism of steroid hormones, vitamin D and some neurotransmitters, and the reduction of tiredness and fatigue. \n\nVitamin B6 (pyridoxine) contributes to the normal function of the immune system, the regulation of hormonal activity, normal cysteine synthesis, normal energy-yielding metabolism, normal homocysteine metabolism, normal protein and glycogen metabolism and the reduction of tiredness and fatigue. \n\nVitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin) contributes to normal energy-yielding metabolism, normal functioning of the nervous system, normal homocysteine metabolism, normal psychological function, normal red blood cell formation, normal function of the immune system, the reduction of tiredness and fatigue and it has a role in the process of cell division.
